### Hello!

Hello, world, and welcome to the first post of my blog. 

This blog was born from one of the many New Year's resolutions that I made at the beginning of 2015. I made a pledge to create a website and actively update it with a blog post at least once a week. Seeing as how it is now nearing the end of February, this first post has long been overdue. Suffice to say, I need to get off (or sit down?) my lazy ass and write some blog posts to catch up to my original quota. 

### Motivations

I have always wanted to create and maintain my own website. I still remember the good ol' days when everyone hosted their personal webpages on GeoCities. As a child, dazzled and inspired by flashing text and animated GIF images, I ventured to join the ranks of online netizens by painstakingly hand crafting a simple HTML page in a text editor, just to tell the whole world wide web that my page was online and under construction. However, I never did generate any content to make it past that first welcome page ...

But no more! Today marks the first step beyond "Under Construction". I am a much more interesting person now (though some may disagree) with <s>many</s> some things to share with the world!

That being said, why am I even making a blog? If I had to piece together my motivation for making this site, I would say:

1. I want to practice putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard?). I think that it will be good to spend some time writing something once or twice a week to practice the process of formulating thoughts into words. I am not much of a wordsmith, but as the saying goes, practice makes perfect, or something like that. 
2. I am looking for a reason to dive into programming projects. By starting this blog, I will guilt myself into actively working on a project in my free time, lest I disappoint myself and my many Internet fans. I am an `R` enthusiast with experience in some other languages, such as Python and Java. I have an inkling of an idea that may become my first project to share with the world.
3. I am thinking of increasing my online presence. I want to put some work into expanding my online social network and engaging others via social networking hubs like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. And what better way is there to entice people to befriend me than to lead those that will inevitably stalk me on the Internet to my website?

### To Do

I will be spending my next chunk of free time figuring out this Jekyll thing. There is still a lot to do before I can really say I "started a website", such as naming my blog, creating an "About Me" page and moving away from the default theme. I think I may need to make a streamlined process for making blog posts -- if posting is not made as easy as possible, I am afraid that I may fall back to not writing. Maybe my next post will be about my blog posting process.

That's all for now. And so, once again, welcome to my blog. I hope to see you again soon.
